    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The A* Pathfinding algorithm is a widely-used method for finding the shortest path between two points. It
      visualizes the search process
      by progressively expanding a search space (blue cells) and ultimately marking the shortest path (yellow cells).
    </p>
    <h3>Heuristic and Search Details</h3>
    <p>
      A* uses a heuristic to guide its search. This heuristic is calculated as the sum of three parameters:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>g(n):</b> The exact cost of the path from the start node to the current node.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>h(n):</b> The estimated cost from the current node to the goal node, often based on Manhattan Distance in
        grid-based environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>f(n):</b> The total estimated cost of the path through the current node: <code>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At each step, the algorithm selects the node with the lowest <code>f(n)</code> from the open set (unvisited
      neighbors).
      This balance of exact and estimated costs allows A* to prioritize efficient paths while avoiding unnecessary
      exploration.
    </p>
    <h3>Unweighted vs Weighted Grids</h3>
    <p>
      For simplicity, this grid is unweighted, meaning that all edges have the same cost, and the search space is
      uniform.
      As a result, Dijkstra and BFS would form a concentric ring pattern expanding outwards from the source node,
      exploring all neighbors level by level.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the grid were weighted, the cost of traveling between cells would vary depending on the weight assigned to each
      cell, affecting the pathfinding process. In this scenario:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A* would still prioritize the path with the lowest <code>f(n)</code>, but the <code>g(n)</code> value would
        change to reflect the different weights, impacting the overall search and the path chosen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dijkstra’s algorithm would also be affected, as the varying weights would influence the shortest path
        calculation, potentially resulting in a different path than when the grid is unweighted.
      </li>
      <li>
        BFS cannot be effectively used on a weighted grid, as it assumes all steps have the same cost and cannot account
        for varying edge costs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Visualization Details</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Blue cells represent nodes visited during the search, indicating the algorithm’s exploration of possible
        paths.</li>
      <li>Yellow cells highlight the shortest path from the start (green) to the destination (red).</li>
      <li>Black cells are obstacles that the algorithm avoids, dynamically shaping the search space.</li>
    </ul>
