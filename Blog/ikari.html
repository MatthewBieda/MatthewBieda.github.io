      <h2>Rendering Settings</h2>
      <p>
        I began by configuring Unreal Engine’s rendering settings. Since I didn’t need dynamic global illumination, I
        disabled <strong>Lumen</strong> and opted for fully baked lighting instead. I also turned off <strong>Lumen
          Reflections</strong> in favor of <strong>Spherical Reflection Probes</strong>, and increased the
        <strong>Reflection Capture Resolution</strong> to 1024 for sharper, higher-fidelity reflections.
        I disabled Mesh Distance Field generation as I wasn’t using DFAO, and turned off <strong>Nanite</strong> due to
        my use of traditional low-poly meshes.
      </p>

      <h2>Post Processing & Forward Rendering</h2>
      <p>
        Most post-processing effects were disabled, including Motion Blur, Lens Flares, Chromatic Aberration, Depth of
        Field, and Film Grain since I prefer a cleaner look. I also switched the rendering path from
        <strong>Deferred</strong>
        to <strong>Forward+ (Forward Shading)</strong>, which enables <strong>MSAA</strong> for crisper visuals and is
        generally more performant (why it is recommended for VR).
        Although Forward+ lacks the G-Buffer and some screen-space effects, Unreal Engine 5 supports
        <strong>SSAO</strong> in forward mode, which I made use of. I added a <strong>Post Process Volume</strong> (set
        to Infinite Extent), disabled auto-exposure, and manually increased the exposure compensation to achieve a
        balanced look.

      <h2>Lighting Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        To bake lighting effectively, I enabled the <strong>HDRI Backdrop</strong> plugin and added a high-resolution
        HDRI for ambient light. I set the HDRI intensity to 2 for baking, then reduced it to 0.4 during gameplay for
        subtlety.
        I enclosed the playable area in a <strong>Lightmass Importance Volume</strong> and placed <strong>Lightmass
          Portals</strong> at windows to better guide indirect light. Commonly rectangular lights are also added on
        windows for direct illumination, but I found my scene looked better without them.
        Additional <strong>Point Lights</strong> were placed in the living room with a color temperature of 4500K to
        provide a warm, cozy feel.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection Captures</h2>
      <p>
        I used multiple <strong>Sphere Reflection Capture</strong> actors, placing one at the center of each room and
        smaller ones near reflective objects. Spheres gave better results than boxes, which is also aligned with
        Unreal’s recommendations.
      </p>

      <h2>Mesh Import & Lightmap Setup</h2>
      <p>
        While importing meshes, I made sure to <strong>generate Lightmap UVs</strong> and disabled Nanite. I adjusted
        lightmap resolution from <strong>64 to 512</strong> depending on object size.
        The <strong>Lightmap Density view mode</strong> proved invaluable for checking resolution balance across
        objects.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Lightmass & SSAO Settings</h2>
      <p>
        I tuned the <strong>Lightmass Settings</strong> under <em>World Settings</em> for high-quality bakes and ambient
        occlusion, which I paired with <strong>SSAO</strong> via the post process volume.

      <h2>Gameplay & Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        I created a custom <strong>interactable interface</strong> and had all relevant Blueprint actors implement it. I
        also developed a basic <strong>first-person character controller</strong>, and layered in audio through
        background music and sound cues to enhance immersion.
